# E-Trees Web App

Welcome to the eTrees web application! This project is designed to educate users by providing valuable information about trees. By utilizing technology, we generate unique QR codes that are attached to specific trees. When scanned, these QR codes provide detailed information about the corresponding trees.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the web app.
- **CSS**: For styling and creating an aesthetically pleasing user interface.
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity to the web app.
- **jQuery**: A JavaScript library that simplifies DOM manipulation and event handling.
- **QR Code Package**: A Node.js package used to generate QR codes for the trees.

## Project Features

- **Two-Sided Access**: The application has both an admin side and a user side:
  - **Admin Side**: 
    - Admins have a dedicated page to manage all functions related to tree information.
    - They can add, update, or delete tree details as needed.
    - Admins can generate QR codes for each tree, ensuring that users receive accurate and up-to-date information.
  
  - **User Side**: 
    - Users can view detailed information about various trees.
    - They have the option to read about the trees and download QR code scanners to access information conveniently.

- **QR Code Generation**: Each tree has a unique QR code that, when scanned, reveals important details about the tree.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with simplicity in mind to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to educate individuals about the significance of trees and their information. By integrating QR codes, users can easily access tree-related data, fostering an appreciation for nature. 

Being me, I cannot attach QR codes to every tree in the world. Therefore, my aim is to encourage users who visit our website to download the QR codes and attach them to the relevant trees in their surroundings, such as in temples, campuses, farms, and more.
